A spot for all my custom CSS tweaks for a non-commercial woo theme

I am modifying WooCommerce Astra theme to make it a library of lesson plans. That includes changing the shop to a table view, and hiding product images and prices.
This website also has a PROJECT where I am dumping all the how-to info for our editors
