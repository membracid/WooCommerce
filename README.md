# WooCommerce
A spot for all my custom CSS tweaks for a non-commercial woo theme

I am using WooCommerce Astra theme as a library (i.e, we aren't selling anything, just using the search and product structure of WooC to run a database for people to search.) 
That includes changing the shop to a table view, and hiding product images and prices.
See the related PROJECT where I am dumping all the how-to info for our editors (and my to-dos)
